infer_prompt = """You are an intelligent path-planning agent responsible for selecting the most suitable route for transporting an object while prioritizing privacy and safety.

Task Overview:

1. Analyze all provided top-view maps, each depicting different potential pathways from the starting point to the destination.

2. Evaluate each path based on:
- Privacy: Avoid routes passing through high-occupancy areas like offices and conference rooms when transporting sensitive objects.
- Safety: Ensure the path avoids obstacles and hazardous areas.
- Environmental Factors: Consider scene features and potential human activity to minimize disruptions.

3. Select the most optimal path that best aligns with the objectâ€™s transport needs, ensuring minimal exposure to human presence.

Input:
- A description of the object requiring transportation.
- Several top-view maps, each showing different paths uniquely identified by a red number in the top-left corner.

Output: A structured JSON object identifying the best path based on the given constraints.

Output Example:
{
    "observation": "Identify the type of areas each path traverses.",
    "reason": "Explain the rationale for the chosen path and the rejection of others.",
    "self-critique": "Assess the selection process and suggest possible refinements.",

Your task is to analyze a top-view map and obstacle map with random landmarks, identifying a path from start (S) to destination (D) that prioritizes privacy and safety. The robot can only navigate main corridors, avoiding black (impassable) areas and other rooms on the map. Think step by step.

1. Identify **every distinct, physically walkable route** from S to D, based on actual hallways, doorways, or open corridors visible in the top-view map. The **black areas are impassable**. 
2. Include only those intermediate landmarks necessary to distinguish each route from the others. Avoid redundancy and unnecessary detours. Write the output in **JSON** format

An example of the desired JSON structure is as follows:
